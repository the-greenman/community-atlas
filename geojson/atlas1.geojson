The program establishes a local Quartiermanagement that manages different types of Neighbourhood Funds, each covering a different type of project and working with the direct involvement of residents.

For years the association has been active at Mehringplatz and in Donaukiez. In the area of ​​educational work, the association operates two learning workshops in Kreuzberg and Neukölln as well as three day nurseries that work with the concept of discovery learning. The offer of the learning workshops is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 years. It aims to support the learning and learning motivation of adolescents and their interest in exploring their natural and social environment as an essential prerequisite for a successful educational process. The different offers take into account the different living conditions and lifestyles of the families in order to give the children a variety of access to educational processes. The work promotes the special interests and abilities of children and strengthens families as important educational partners for their children.\n\nThe second focus of our work is the development of neighborhood structures at Mehringplatz. As part of its offers, the club has established a good contact with the neighborhood. Through various activities (festivals, flea market, book rental), the association is known in the area and has already on numerous occasions supported residents to develop and implement offers for a neighborly gathering. From January 2015, the Neighborhood Commissioner will also be a permanent contact person for the residents of the neighborhood, with whom joint projects can be developed and implemented. The Neighborhood Café on Mehringplatz 7 also offers a public space where people from the neighborhood meet, articulate their needs and interests and use the place for encounters. The association is well connected with other social and cultural institutions and other organizations (Gewobag, Mieterbeirat, education network, tradesmen, AOK, Platzgärtner etc.) in the quarter. Through the daily presence in the square we know the existing problems, but also see the potential of the neighborhood, to whose development we would like to make our contribution.\n",
